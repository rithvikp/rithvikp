I'm Rithvik, a college student studying computer science and business. Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rithvik-p/) for details about my past experiences or reach out to me via email at `rtpanch@gmail.com`.

Unfortunately, most of my current work is closed-source (at least for the time-being), so there's not too much too see here. However, if you are interested, check out [dotfiles](https://github.com/rithvikp/dotfiles) for my current Vim configuration or [pathfinder](https://github.com/metrobot-research/pathfinder) for an (in progress) custom implementation of Pure Pursuit. Some of my other projects include an end-to-end compiler (including a preprocessor) for a custom programming language, my own implementation of a subset of git (including the ability to merge branches and push/pull from remote sources), and a code generator that uses YAMl schemas to create API types and definitions for a variety of languages (including generated validation code).
