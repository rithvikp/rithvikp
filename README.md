I'm Rithvik, a college student studying computer science and business. Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rithvik-p/) for detail about my past experiences or reach out to me via email at `rtpanch@gmail.com`.

Unfortunately, most of my current work is closed-source (at least for the time-being), so there's not too much too see here. However, if you are interested, check out [dotfiles](https://github.com/rithvikp/dotfiles) for my current Vim configuration or [pathfinder](https://github.com/metrobot-research/pathfinder) for an (in progress) custom implementation of Pure Pursuit.
